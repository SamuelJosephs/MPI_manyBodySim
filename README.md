# MPI_manyBodySim

This is a simple simulation making use of the leap-frog method.

For an Earth-Sun-Jupiter system the simulation with a timestep of one day over the course of a year, energy is conserved within 0.007%.

Now that the simulation is working the next stage is to apply it to systems of thousands of particles simulating gravitational collapse.


I have only tested the build on NixOS but should work on any operating system provided the Nix package manager is installed.
